This directory contains sensitive data you may consider to backup
(credentials, aliases, configurations, mails).

Do not attempt to modify these files, if you need to customize
something:

- edit `config.ini`
- just `make`

If you need more than what is exposed in `config.ini`, do not hesitate
to open an issue!
